Publishing an iOS app can be stressful, especially when the App Review team rejects your submission for avoidable issues. Here are four important tips to help you pass review smoothly and avoid unnecessary delays.

## 🔍 1. Use Correct Device Screenshots

First impressions matter, and Apple takes this seriously. Ensure your screenshots match the actual device type:

- **For iPhone apps**: Use iPhone-sized screenshots
- **For iPad apps**: Use iPad-sized screenshots
- **Important**: Never stretch or resize iPhone images to fit iPad requirements

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Many rejections happen after version 1.0 updates simply because the screenshots weren't updated to match the device requirements.

## 🗑️ 2. Include a "Delete Account" Option

If your app includes any form of user account creation (email, social login, etc.), you must provide an in-app account deletion option:

- Should completely remove user data in compliance with privacy regulations

## 🚪 3. Allow Users to Skip Login (When Possible)

Don't force users to create an account right away:

- Allow guest access when possible
- Only require sign-up when absolutely necessary
- Explain the benefits of creating an account


## 🍏 4. Add "Sign in with Apple" for Social Logins

If you offer third-party sign-in options, Apple requires you to include their authentication method:

- Required if you offer other social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Provides users with privacy-focused authentication
