# 📦 Ship Fly

**Ship Fly** is a smart, modern Flutter application designed for **tracking packages** across **air (fly)**, **sea (container/ship)**, and **land (vehicle/truck)**.

Track your orders **live** with real-time updates on where your package is:  

- 🛫 In the air  
- 🚢 In the container  
- 🚛 On the road  
- 📍 Or already in your city!

> **🔍 Know exactly what’s inside, where it is, and when it will arrive — all in one place!**
